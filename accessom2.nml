    ! ice_ocean_timestep defines the MOM baroclinic timestep, CICE thermodynamic timestep
    ! and MOM-CICE coupling interval, in seconds.
    ! ice_ocean_timestep is normally a factor of the ERA5 forcing period of 1hr = 3600s,
    ! e.g. one of 100, 120, 144, 150, 180, 200, 225, 240, 300, 360, 400, 450, 600, 720, 900,
