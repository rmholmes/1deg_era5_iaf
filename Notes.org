R. Holmes notes for getting ERA5 1deg config testing.
2022
** Initial setup:
See git

Problems encountered:
- Can't run with time step >3600 (1 hr, ERA-5 forcing time step)
- Can't start in 1979-01-01 because of bad timing (start 1980 first).
- Can't deal with leap years (issue with libaccessom2 that has now
  been fixed by Micael).

- Regridding weights appear to flip latitude and offset longitude
  (https://github.com/COSIMA/esmgrids/issues/4).

** Generating ATM -> ICE OASIS, regridding weights

With Andrew/Nic's updated make_regrid_weights.py that includes ERA5
options:

In /g/data/e14/rmh561/access-om2/input/ERA-5 do:

module purge
module load openmpi
module load nco
module load esmf
module use /g/data/hh5/public/modules
module load conda/analysis3

and then:
../../tools/make_remap_weights.py --accessom2_input_dir ../ --atm_forcing_file /g/data/rt52/era5/single-levels/reanalysis/10u/1980/10u_era5_oper_sfc_19800101-19800131.nc --atm ERA5 --ocean MOM1 --npes 1

As a first test, I'm rerunning the results I had before with my
regridding files to see if there are any differences - this checks
out.

Andrew's changes do not work for me.

Now trying to fix the latitude flipped stuff. Successfully ran it by
just removing the warnings - which don't work for ERA-5 flipped
latitude anyway.

No matter what I do in era5_grid.py the result seems to be the
same. I've tried adding 90, 180 and 360 to x_t with no
results. Similarly undoing the flip on y_t seems not to do anything.

Russ says that they have always flipped the data back when using ERA
Interim or ERA5 data.

I wasn't using my new remap files because they should be through the
common input files not the "atmosphere" ones. Corrected and working
through again...

Nic's files: Checks and yes it works and gives me the same changes as
before (8528adfe1df71 commit).

My generation (with above command on git branch of access-om2
update-esmgrids-preRussCorrection): Works and fixes the longitude
shift!!

Removing the `flipud` on the latitude fixes the latitude error.

So now we proceed further...

** With fixed regridding weights...

With fixed regridding weights I can get to October 31st of year 2 and
then it blows-up (1982-10-31). Have dropped the time step to 1800s and
doesn't make a difference.

** Runoff fixed

We were trying to use the wrong ERA-5 variable for river runoff. Now
we've reverted to using the JRA-55 friver variable (required some
namcouple reversions as well). This seems to have fixed the runoff
issues.

Now (also with the leap year fix in libaccessom2) I can get to
1982-11-01 starting from 1980-01-01 and then it blows up with temp out
of range. Clearly there is an issue at this time.

** RYF files:
These work, but are very slow, probably because the time chunking is
bad (760 something). 

Aidan rewrote the RYF processing script and it works wayyy better. Run
times are now ->

** Single-year runtimes (1-degree):
1deg JRA-55 RYF9091 and IAF:  ~15 mins
1deg ERA-5 IAF: ~60 mins
1deg ERA-5 RYF (badly chunked): ~132 mins
1deg ERA-5 RYF (well chunked/uncompressed): ~40 mins
025deg JRA-55 RYF9091: ~97 mins
025deg ERA-5 RYF9091: ~113 mins

** IAF runs:
Starting in 1980-01-01 I can't get past 1982-11-01
Starting in 1983-01-01 I can't get past 1984-09-01
Starting in 1990-01-01 I can't get past 1991-07-01
Starting in 2000-01-01 I can't get past 2001-02-01
Starting in 2005-01-01 I can't get past 2006-07-01
Why is it always on the 01 day?

Revisiting this November 2022:
Starting from 1980-01-01 with clean setup, I get temperature out of
range errors that blow up in 1981-11-01, within the first
hour. Outputing tracer diagnostics shows that this comes up very
suddenly, only in November.

The add_offset and scale_factor values of the t2m files change every
month. So when you look at multiple months of data with ncview, it
uses the scale_factor and add_offset (presumably) of the first month
only, and thus each month after that is wrong and there are jumps at
the end/start of month.

xarray doesn't have this problem as it correctly uses each month's
scale_factor and add_offset.

The question is - what does access-om2 do? Are the dates above where
the data goes wrong particularly bad add_offset jumps? is there some
problem with interpolation across the ends of the months? Or is it
unrelated to this issue?

The problem is even worse for tau_x. E.g., the add_offset's for 1982
are:
                u10:add_offset = -1.10877391482281 ;
                u10:add_offset = -1.1215841955099 ;
                u10:add_offset = 0.0125949346145859 ;
                u10:add_offset = -1.53913651675738 ;
                u10:add_offset = -2.75968769557738 ;
                u10:add_offset = -2.13865433273629 ;
                u10:add_offset = -1.76729693885812 ;
                u10:add_offset = -3.29618059715136 ;
                u10:add_offset = -16.5649987171096 ;
                u10:add_offset = -57.4015155174217 ;
                u10:add_offset = -2.02439977535769 ;
                u10:add_offset = 0.954945670431101 ;

The jump from Oct to Nov is ridiculous in ncview time series (see
screenshot). Is the same true for the other dates - not really, at
least in u10 it's not obvious. But perhaps all it needs is a big jump
in just one particular variable?

Or, is it that there is something in the data that causes these large
add_offset values??

1984-09:

** 1/4-degree development

Started from latest JRA55 025 RYF config and changed according to
1deg_jra55_ryf and 1deg_era5_ryf differences.

Generated remapping weights by

cd /g/data/e14/rmh561/access-om2/input/ERA-5/remap

module purge
module load openmpi
module load nco
module load esmf
module use /g/data/hh5/public/modules
module load conda/analysis3

../../../tools/make_remap_weights.py --accessom2_input_dir /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om2/input_20201102/ --atm_forcing_file /g/data/rt52/era5/single-levels/reanalysis/10u/1980/10u_era5_oper_sfc_19800101-19800131.nc --atm ERA5 --ocean MOM025 --npes 1

NOTE!!: accessom2_input_dir has to match the input directory you're
using for MOM in config.yaml. Otherwise the masks can be different and
this changes the remapping file of course...

That seems to work fine. Run is stable. Had to reduce time step at one
point (year 18ish?) to get past a ice thermo issue but otherwise fine.
